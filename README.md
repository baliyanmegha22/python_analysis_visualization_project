Project: California Dataset Analysis & Visualization

Description: As part of this project, I conducted a thorough analysis and visualization of a California dataset to uncover valuable insights. I delved into crucial aspects like the average median income, data distribution, and the correlation between median_income and median_house_values. Furthermore, I adeptly handled missing data, implemented custom functions for calculating medians, and generated compelling geographic plots. Additionally, I created subsets based on ocean_proximity and skillfully categorized total_bedroom sizes. This project highlights my proficiency in data science, showcasing expertise in data analysis, visualization, and programming techniques.
